RISE REST API Creator
Introduction:
REST API and micro services are the most common part of the modern software development techniques. It faciltiates software developers to build the backend modules and add required business logic at the appropriae place. In current scinario, use's module (web site, mobile application, terminals, IoT devices) communicated with the REST endpoints which processes the data and stored in the database. This software provides a source code of generating REST API templates basedon the defined object in the JSON. This JSON Obect has folloiwng fields.

      "metaData":"String",
      "role":"String",
      "sha256":"String",

      "ecdsa":"String",

      "others":"String"
   },
   "idColumn":"sha256"
}
